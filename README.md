# Infinitive Scroll

This is a simple training app based on HTML, CSS and Javascript. It allows:
 - Feth the data in JSON format from the [Unsplash Api](https://unsplash.com/developers).
 - Insert the photos into the DOM on initial loading.
 - When the user scrolls close to the bottom of the page the app makes another GET request to the API and inserts photos into the DOM (lazy loading).
